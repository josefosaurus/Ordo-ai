// whole test binary that must never spawn a real process for any of its
// tests overrides the package-level DefaultSpawn once, in its TestMain (see

// they install).

// no test anywhere in the module can ever start a real child process or
// reach the network merely by exercising install/update/sync/review code

// child must never write to a terminal the triggering command no longer
// owns. It never blocks the caller and never surfaces the child's exit

// The payload is written to an os.Pipe and closed for writing BEFORE
// Start(), and Stdin is set to the pipe's read end directly (an *os.File,
// not a Reader). This matters: had Stdin been a bytes.Reader, os/exec would
// copy it into the child through an internal goroutine that only runs to
// completion if something waits for it (normally cmd.Wait()) — but this
// sender deliberately never waits inline, and the whole point of a detached
// sender is that the parent process may exit almost immediately after
// Start() returns. That copy goroutine lives in the PARENT process, so a
// parent that exits before the goroutine finishes truncates or empties the
// child's stdin. Passing an *os.File instead makes exec dup the descriptor
// straight into the child with no parent-side copying at all: the bytes are
// already sitting in the kernel pipe buffer (comfortably larger than this
// contract's 4 KiB ceiling) by the time Start() is called, so the child can
// read them on its own schedule, entirely independent of the parent's
// lifetime.
